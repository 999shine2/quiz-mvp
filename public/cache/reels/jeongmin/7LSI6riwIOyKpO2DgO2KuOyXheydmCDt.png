There are fewer layers of approval, less bureaucracy, and communication is more direct. This is crucial for early-stage startups that need to quickly iterate on their product or business model.\\n*   **Clear Communication and Cohesion:** With only a few people, communication is naturally more efficient. Everyone is likely to be on the same page, understand the vision, and have a strong sense of shared purpose. This reduces misunderstandings and improves overall team cohesion.\\n*   **Resource Efficiency:** Early-stage startups often operate with very limited funding. A smaller team means lower salary expenses, less need for office space, and fewer resources consumed overall. This allows the startup to stretch its runway further.\\n*   **Defined Roles and Accountability:** In a small team, each member's role is usually very clear, and they are directly accountable for their responsibilities. There's less room for people to hide or for tasks to fall through the cracks.\\n*   **Stronger Culture Formation:** The initial team members play a huge role in shaping the company's culture. With a small, dedicated group, it's easier to establish core values, work ethics, and a shared vision that will serve as the foundation for future growth.\\n*   **Easier Conflict Resolution:** While conflicts can still arise, they are generally easier to address and resolve in a small group where direct communication is more common.\\n*   **Focus on Core Product/Service:** A lean team is forced to prioritize and focus on the absolute essentials – typically developing the core product or service and finding product-market fit. This prevents early-stage startups from getting sidetracked by non-essential activities.\\n*   **Increased Ownership and Motivation:** Each member of a small, early-stage team often feels a greater sense of ownership and impact on the company's success. This can lead to higher motivation and dedication.\\n\\nWhile there are many benefits to starting small, it's also important that the 2-3 individuals bring a diverse and complementary set of skills to cover the essential areas of product development, business, and operations.\",\"timingInfo\":[{\"step\":\"Request received.\",\"timestamp\":0},{\"step\":\"Start generating job\",\"timestamp\":0},{\"step\":\"Start processing\",\"timestamp\":0}],\"requestId\":\"jzpz1s\",\"requestParameters\":{\"prompt\":\"초기 스타트업의 팀 규모를 2~3명으로 제한하는 것이 좋다고 이야기하는 주된 이유는 무엇일까요\",\"seed\":42,\"model\":\"nanobanana\",\"enhance\":false,\"negative_prompt\":\"undefined\",\"nofeed\":false,\"safe\":false,\"quality\":\"medium\",\"image\":[],\"transparent\":false,\"audio\":false,\"width\":1024,\"height\":1024},\"queueInfo\":null}","code":"BAD_REQUEST","timestamp":"2026-01-30T04:04:31.356Z"},"status":400}
